## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)

### File Organization
- Components in `src/components/`
- Pages in `src/pages/`
- Utilities in `src/utils/`
- Contexts in `src/contexts/`

### Naming Conventions
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `MemoryCard.jsx`)
- Functions: camelCase (e.g., `handleUpload`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- CSS classes: kebab-case (e.g., `memory-card`)

## Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and pull requests

Examples:
```
feat: Add bulk delete functionality
fix: Resolve thumbnail generation error
